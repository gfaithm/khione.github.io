              <p align="justify"> When you visit a supermarket you’ll find lots of snacks and drinks displayed on the shelves.
                Nowadays, snacks and drinks are attractively packaged, convincing customers to buy them. However, if you look
                at them closely, many of these items contain high levels of sugar, sodium, and often artificial food coloring.
                Those ingredients are unhealthy, especially for young children. That’s why we decided to produce and sell some
                healthy and nutritious food with higher quality for the Santa Ursula Jakarta Middle School Community. <br>
                <br> We planned to make yogurt and chicken. Before starting the production process, we had to find out what
                things we needed, like ingredients and tools, and how to produce them. We found sources by searching the
                internet and by personal experience. After we fully understood, we looked for the ingredients and equipment
                that we needed. With everything prepared, we were ready to produce healthy food.

              <p align="justify"> Fresh cow milk was the main ingredient for both yogurt and cheese. We began by heating the
                milk to a certain temperature. When we made yogurt, 2 tablespoons of plain yogurt should be added and mixed
                with milk until they were blended. Then the mixture was poured into a jar and closed tightly and it was
                chilled in the refrigerator for less than a day. As for the cheese, vinegar was added into the milk to
                separate the solid particles of the milk. After that, we can separate them by draining it using a cheesecloth
                to take the potential cheese, then salt was added to give more flavor. We molded the cheese into whatever
                shape we liked and covered it with aluminum foil, then chilled it in the refrigerator for at least 1 day. <br>
                <br>
                Basically, making yogurt and cheese is not as hard as we may think. However, the hardest part was heating the
                milk. We need to heat the milk to the exact temperature, because if we boil it too hot or too cold it will not
                transform into yogurt or cheese. Our first attempt failed because the milk was heated for too long. So, we had
                to repeat the procedure. After trying the second time, we finally succeeded in making cheese and yogurt.

              <p align="justify"> Next, for our chicken popcorn, lots of spices had to be used to make the dish tasty and
                flavorful. This actually took quite a while to make, thanks to the marination process that had to be done the
                night before cooking the chicken. The cubed chicken was marinated with egg and soy for a night. Then, once the
                chicken was ready, we could mix the ingredients for the crispy skin. After that, we could start to coat the
                chicken with an egg mixture first before coating it with a layer of the spices. We have to dip it in the egg
                mixture first so that all the spices can form a thick layer around the chicken. Our trial was very successful,
                so when the time came to make the chicken at school, we had no trouble at all. <br> <br>
                In conclusion, making healthy food is not impossible for us. Before buying snacks and drinks, it is important
                to find out whether they are healthy or not. If we can’t find healthy food or drink in the market, we can
                always make our own using better ingredients. We can also be creative and create whatever we like. We should
                prioritize our own health and the people we care about.
